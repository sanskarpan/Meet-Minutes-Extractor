Project Nova - Creative Brainstorm

Date: July 15, 2024
Participants: David, Chloe, Ben

Topic: Q4 Marketing Campaign

Notes from the session:
- We need a big idea for the holiday season. The current "Future Forward" slogan is getting a bit stale.
- David pitched a "Day in the Life" video series showing our engineers using the product in creative ways. Could be authentic, but might be hard to produce.
- Chloe suggested an influencer partnership. She mentioned MacroTech Reviews as a potential partner. Ben is worried about the budget for a big influencer.
- We talked about a possible tagline: "Build Tomorrow, Today." General consensus was that it's okay, but not amazing.
- Okay, so the path forward is to explore both of David's and Chloe's ideas. We've decided not to pursue a new slogan right now and will stick with "Future Forward" but with new visuals.
- Action: Chloe needs to get some cost estimates for MacroTech and two other smaller tech influencers. She said she'll have it by the end of the week.
- Action: David will put together a one-page concept brief for the video series idea so we can see what it would actually look like. He'll get that done by this Friday, July 19th.
- Ben needs to finalize the Q4 marketing budget and let us know what we can realistically spend. He said he'll have the final number by our next meeting.

Next meeting is scheduled for next Wednesday to review the concepts and budget.
